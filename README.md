# Charactor Controller With Unity (Learn Project) (Not done)
## PREFACE
 A unity project contains a comprehandsive charactor controller of first & third person shooting game, which is a project for my game program learning.
 
 It contains a lot of basis module for charactor controller, such as input system, moving controller, animation events listener, etc.(just because i only done these) and it will continue to be larger and more useful.
 
 Now it still has a lot of bugs at physics system.
In addition, most of the model and sound resources are come from the Internet(including unity assets store) in this project.
